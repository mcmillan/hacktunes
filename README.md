# HackTunes

Hello! This is a crafty little project I made for the [Facebook London Office Opening Hackathon](http://www.amiando.com/facebooklondonhackathon.html).

It's essentially quick-fire song guessing game - multiple users log in with Facebook, and when somebody hits 'start game', it will pick out the recent listens of all the players in the game, play one of those songs and the first person to guess it wins! It's easy as cheese.

This won the prize for best [Deezer](http://deezer.com) integration, which means I get to spend a week in France. Woohoo!
